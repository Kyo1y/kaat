# Team Contract

Within your group, agree on a group contract that will govern your collaboration. The contract should spell out the behaviors you expect of all group members, as well as procedures for resolving impasses in the group.

Specific questions to think about include the following:

* What is our level of ambition for this project?
* How will we communicate with each other?
* How often and where will we meet?
* Who is the Product Owner and who is the Scrum Facilitator/Master for each milestone? (I suggest that you rotate the role of the scrum facilitator.)
* How will we make sure that our meetings are productive?
* Once we start implementing, how are we going to manage our git repository?
* What will we do if some team member contributes significantly less than others?
* What will we do if some team member violates any agreements in this contract?

Each team member should signal their agreement with this contract by adding their name at the bottom.
